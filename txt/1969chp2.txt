2: Recorded Live in Your Face
1969: IOOX: THE ASIAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE——DWINELLE HALL, UC BERKELEY
Pan of lecture hall, two hundred STUDENTS crowded into presidium seating, some in the aisles. The majority, if not all, of the STUDENTS are of Asian descent. On the platform, STUDENTS are also sitting on tables or standing before the long blackboard like guards. A few of the STUDENTS are dressed in fatigues and berets, sporting dark glasses, but most are conservatively dressed, men in plain shirts and slacks, women in skirts and knit sweaters. Women have short bubble cuts or long straight hair; the men, short cuts that are beginning to straggle or bush out. Horn-rimmed glasses for the men, more stylish glasses on the women. Some slump in their seats, their feet hung over the backs of chairs; others sit at attention with pens and notebooks.
One STUDENT speaks from the podium.
STUDENT ORGANIZER
O.K.! First order of business, (points in the aisle) JB, that's James Baba. James, wave your hand.
JAMES BABA is in the aisle passing out issues of the AAPA newspaper. Waves.
STUDENT ORGANIZER
Right on. We call him JB because his other life is being James Brown, (laughter) I'm serious, the man can move! But right now, he's moving to hand you important information.
Another STUDENT approaches the podium and whispers something into the speaker's ear.
STUDENT ORGANIZER
Oh yeah, (nods to other STUDENT) Right. Professor Taka-
KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
bayashi, respectfully, we are going to ask you to leave the room for just a few minutes. We have business to conduct, and we don't want to compromise your position in any way.
PROFESSOR TAKABAYASHI nods and walks up the aisle out of the room.
STUDENT ORGANIZER
Number one: we want you to check out page three of the • AAPA paper, Revolutionary First Aid. Review this material. By now you've heard the news that Cordell Abercrombie, an Afro-American Student Union member, was seized by six plainclothes pigs and beaten up in the basement of Sproul Hall, then charged with felonious assault. That was Thursday. And you know that the day prior, Wednesday, Reagan declared a state of extreme emergency, so that Chief Madigan and his Alameda sheriff pigs could have the excuse to beat us up. So this is serious. Do your homework and come prepared.
ANOTHER STUDENT ORGANIZER
Right. Check out what it says about mace and tear gas. Also important, protecting your collarbone. Get some padding in that area. Wear a helmet and get yourself some goggles. Don't bring anything with you except your ID, nothing the pigs could use to get information from you, and no dope, no weapons, and no big pockets they can fill to plant shit on you. And memorize our central command telephone number. You get arrested, you have a right to a phone call. Write the number on your arm. Hey, JB, what's that number?
JAMES BABA writes a telephone number on the chalkboard.
STUDENT ORGANIZER
So the word is: Tomorrow, meet at Wheeler Oak, eleven a.m. sharp. Got that? And right after this class, strike captains stay for an emergency meeting. If you have any questions, talk to your strike captain.

STUDENT ORGANIZER
(runs up to the podium) I just wanted to make an announcement. We're organizing a community field component for this course at the I-Hotel in the City. That's 848 Kearny Street in Manilatown-Chinatown. This weekend we're doing painting and repairs. If you're interested in joining, see me after class.
PROFESSOR TAKABAYASHI is ushered back into the room and takes the podium. A WHITE PROFESSOR accompanies him.
PROFESSOR TAKABAYASHI
Today, I'm going to turn this over to my colleague in anthropology, Professor Harold Hass. You've had a chance to read his article on Japanese psychology and should be prepared with your questions. Professor?
PROFESSOR HASS
Assuming that you've read my work, let me entertain some questions first. Yes? (points into audience)
STUDENT
A question came up in discussion about the work of Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, that in the first place she never went to Japan, and in the second, she studied Japanese Americans in the internment camps to get her • material. So how does she justify using people in prison as her subject matter then applying it to people who were defeated in war?
PROFESSOR HASS
Interesting question. Japanese communities have been ghettoized in the United States, duplicating and sustaining to a high degree cultural traditions, language, family constructions, et cetera, so it's not entirely impossible to draw conclusions from this minority that cross over, but I agree, there are differences.
130
KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
STUDENT
Aren't you in danger of making the same mistake as Benedict? I mean, you go to Japan and study the Japanese and say they are socialized for achievement, then this sort of argument is used on Asian Americans here.
STUDENT
(speaking before the PROFESSOR can respond) It's a stereotype to say we are all high achievers who are playing the assimilation game the right way and getting ahead, so racism in America isn't a factor in our oppression. What's your excuse for teaching about Japan instead of about Japanese Americans?
STUDENT
(yelling from the back) Why doesn't our history count?
PROFESSOR HASS
I think you've jumped to conclusions that I don't claim in my work. I don't claim to be speaking about American Japanese per se.
JAMES BABA
I understand you were on the committee to recommend Ethnic Studies to the chancellor but that your committee excludes student members in the planning.
PROFESSOR HASS
Now that's another matter entirely. I didn't come here to discuss administrative matters.
STUDENTS
(standing up and becoming disruptive, speaking in succession) What do you mean? It's all the same thing. It's about our right to determine our own educational needs.
You want to whitewash it!
This is an example of why we need our own department of
I HOTEL
131
Asian American Studies. We need the folks from our own communities to speak. Not this racist shit.
Who is this guy anyway?
(yells out)
WHADDA WE WANT?
JAMES BABA
STUDENTS
(chanting) SELF-DETERMINATION!
JAMES BABA
WHEN DO WE WANT IT?
STUDENTS
NOW!
STUDENTS move forward down the aisles toward the podium, chanting. Whadda we want? Self-determination! When do we want it?Now! STUDENTS crowd around the professor and usher him out of the lecture hall. STUDENTS jeer and chant.
Rising SOUND of music: James Brown: Say it loud: T'm black and T'm proud!... Uh! Put your pants up!
SATHER GATE——UC BERKELEY
Camera captures wide angle of street moving up Telegraph Avenue toward the university. Cars, buses, vendors, students walking and crossing. Camera crosses Bancroft Avenue, pauses on a group of a dozen STUDENTS, a mix of mostly black, Asian, Mexican, and Native Americans, passing out flyers. One STUDENT holds up a flyer in front of the camera. The camera focuses on the TEXT.
FLYER
SUPPORT THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF THIRD WORLD PEOPLE!!!
THIRD WORLD LIBERATION FRONT STRIKE DEMANDS:
1. Establish a Third World College
2. Recruit Third World people to positions of power
3. Special admissions, financial aid, & work studies for Third World students
4. Third World control of Third World programs
5. No disciplinary actions against any student, faculty, or staff supporting strike
THESE DEMANDS SUPERCEDE ALL OTHER PREVIOUS DEMANDS
Camera continues a wide-angle approach, moving toward Sather Gate across Sproul Plaza, past makeshift tables set up by various organizations, along the Dr. Seuss-style lopped-off sycamores that line the plaza. Camera arrives at Sather Gate with a growing crowd of third world students, many carrying posters: Third World Power Now! TWLF Fights For Unity! AFT Local 570 Supports TWLF Strike! Close It Down! Stop Racism! Dig It! Focus on STUDENT with a bullhorn. SOUND of voice echoing across the plaza.
STUDENT ORGANIZER
(through bullhorn) O.K.! We gotta let everyone know we're here! We are the Third World Liberation Front, and we wanna let this university know who we are. We are a coalition of black, brown, yellow, and red brothers and sisters. We come here together in solidarity, so all you brothers and sisters, say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!

That's better. So now I wanna hear it the loudest for the real Americans: I'm red and I'm proud!
CROWD I'M RED AND I'M PROUD!

(another) One drop, man, one drop's all it takes. You got a drop. Don't say you don't.
STUDENT ORGANIZER
I'm bourgeoisie and I'm proud!
CROWD
(laughter with sporadic yells and hoots) I'M BOURGEOISIE AND I'M PROUD!
As the chanting continues, PICKETERS line up in front of Sather Gate, shoulder to shoulder, arms crossed or holding signs, and feet spread to stand their ground, blocking access across the bridge. Incoming STUDENTS congregate at the impasse unable to cross, forming a traffic jam.
Camera swings to focus on two UNDERCOVER POLICEMEN posing as students, who rush forward to argue with and then accost protesting STUDENTS.
UNDERCOVER POLICE
You're under arrest for blocking a public entrance!
STUDENTS
He's a pig!
That one, he's a fucking spy!
STUDENTS protest and resist arrest, locking arms to maintain the line. This initial confrontation results in calling in a waiting contingent of fifty CAMPUS POLICE and ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFFS in leather jackets with fur collars, face masks, helmets, and billy clubs. Camera bounces around and runs after police actions: clubs pushing bodies and cracking bones, STUDENTS chased across the plaza, shoved into paddy wagons, dragged into the basement of Sproul Hall.
SPROUL HALL BASEMENT——UC BERKELEY
Camera chases behind POLICEMEN dragging a STUDENT dressed in fatigues and wearing horn-rimmed glasses down the stairs to the basement.
POLICEMAN I

POLICEMAN I
They all look alike, (jabs club into the STUDENT'S side) S'gotta be him. (kicks STUDENT)
POLICEMAN 2
It's not him.
POLICEMAN I
Book him anyway. Resisting arrest. Assaulting a policeman. Obstructing entrance to a public place.
SPROUL PLAZA
Outside, a visible force of three hundred POLICE, HIGHWAY PATROLMEN, and SHERIFFS line the steps of Sproul Hall and the plaza. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN in military garb with rifles are stationed near a contingent of jeeps and camouflaged trucks along Bancroft Avenue. An Eyewitness News station wagon is parked on Bancroft. Canisters fly across the plaza, jet streams of tear gas propelled into the sky. STUDENTS scream and run in every direction, covering their faces. Walking slowly but with determination across the plaza, a BLIND WOMAN in dark glasses with a white cane leads ANOTHER WOMAN, who is overcome by the tear gas. ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS have formed themselves into a linked line—a snake dance— scurrying and chanting, in and out and around trees and pillars. Chanting: Third World Power Now! Yellow Power Now! They emerge from the smoke and then disappear into it, passing through Sather Gate. SOUND of chanting growing faint. A helicopter circles overhead.

SOUND of helicopter fades into SOUND of James Brown: "Mother Popcorn."
5         1970: JACL CONVENTION——MIKE MASAOKA TESTIMONIAL DINNER——CONRAD HILTON HOTEL——CHICAGO
Eight hundred capacity ballroom of round tables decorated with tablecloths and flowers and surrounded by well-dressed Japanese American Citizens League delegates. Waiters run around removing plates and pouring coffee and water, passing out desserts, etc. Speeches resound from the podium and then clapping from all around as the honoree, Mike Masaoka, steps to the podium. A group of FOUR SANSEI MEN excuse themselves from their table in the back of the room and leave as the crowd rises to their feet in a standing ovation.
FOUR SANSEI MEN walk powerfully into the Chicago night, four abreast along Michigan Avenue. SOUND of James Brown: "Try Me."
6        1970:    JACL     CONVENTION——LIBERATION     CAUCUS     MEETING—— PALMER HOUSE——CHICAGO
Inside the Palmer House Hotel, room 826. Clothing and suitcases strewn around the room and on the beds and sofas. SANSEI in their late teens to early twenties come and go. Three women come in with ice cream cones, talk and banter with the FOUR SANSEI MEN, who arrive from their walk. Camera follows the group, who leave for a caucus meeting in Parlor A on the sixth floor. Gradually others join the meeting. At some point, a woman bursts into the meeting screaming. Camera follows her with others to room 725. Others are already there, trying to assist two bleeding women. One woman seems to be alive, bleeding from her throat. The other is lifeless on the floor.
SANSEI (scattered voices) Somebody call an ambulance!
It's done. Security should be here. What s taking them so long?
JB, come with me. Maybe the guy's still in the hotel! Check the stairwells!
I HOTEL
137
Right! Someone should go and secure the doors. We're on it. Let's go!
Camera follows SANSEI down stairwells and through the exits. Ambulance and paramedics arrive at the front and move quickly to the seventh floor to move two women out. Flashing lights leaving hotel and SOUND of moaning siren move out into the Chicago night. Commotion of SANSEI entering a taxi and following.
SANSEI (scattered voices) Where's the hospital?
Some place called the Henrotin. Is that for real? The driver should know.
When we get there, we need to set up security. She's a witness. She left a note. Did you take it?
I'm going to lose it. Oh shit. Not now. Not now! O.K., O.K. I'm O.K.
HOUSE AT PINE AND BUCHANAN STREET——SAN FRANCISCO J-TOWN
Camera wanders to street corner, observes the Victorian house, an unpainted, slightly dilapidated place. Panning up to the second-floor window, we see a peace sign, and in another window, a poster of Malcolm X. Camera moves up the stairs and into the house. Living room is strewn with pillows against the bay window. Walls are plastered with various posters of Mao, Che, Malcolm X, Ho Chi Minh, protests, and announcements of concerts and political and cultural events. A GROUP OF MOSTLY SANSEI are sitting around on the sofa and floor, listening to RIA ISHII talk.
RIA ISHII
We went to the hospital with the ambulance and did security there until the police came. When we got back to the Palmer House, no one wanted to go back to their rooms. So everyone stayed in one of the conference rooms with pil- .

lows and blankets and security at the door. I never slept. Next day, the JACL flew us all home.
SANSEI I
Makes you wonder why they had to have the convention in Chicago. Fred Hampton was killed last year. Chicago's the worst. Those pigs will never find the killer. It's all bad news. Now this.
SANSEI II
Yellow Brotherhood drove up from L.A., picked up those Yellow Seed folks in Stockton. Those Stockton girls got in that caravan to Chicago. They were saying stuff like, it's gonna be the Yellow Summer of Love. Now the Stockton brothers are talking about going to Chicago and settling.
RIA ISHII
That's the kind of shit the media wants to hear. So far they've tried to put the blame on the Panthers and the Young Lords, since we went to visit their operations. Media said shit like the girls were flirtatious, suggested that they invited trouble.
JAMES BABA
We've got to step in quickly to counter the media stereotypes and racism and to make our position about this clear.
SOUND of commotion. Camera swings around, captures RIA'S surprised face, then zooms in to catch an arm attached to a gun. Tough sansei dude, MO AKAGI, struts into focus in black beret, shades, and leather gloves and jacket.
MO AKAGI
Where the fuck is he? I'm gonna kill him! Where is he? Is it you, you fucker? (points gun at JAMES BABA) Ria! (points at RIA) Who is he, Ria? You think you can go to Chicago and come back with another man? Who is he? I'm gonna blow his brains out!

Someone grabs AKAGI'S pistol arm and pulls it back. Another jumps him from behind and grabs his neck, pulling him backwards. Everyone topples over. AKAGI flails on the floor and is covered by more men. The gun is thrown across the room; RIA runs over to grab it.
SANSEI I
It's cool, man. It's cool. Get him out of here. Wait, check him out. He's got some kind of armory, (feels him over, checks pockets, boots)
MO AKAGI

MO AKAGI
Hey, where's my piece?

AKAGI is hustled out by several men, just as another GROUP OF SANSEI begins to arrive.

SOUND of AKAGI shouting obscenities down Buchanan as more people begin to arrive at the house. Dusk follows and the street darkens. Camera follows GROUPS into every corner of the house. A couple of GUYS pop reds. A joint and beers are passed around in the kitchen.
SANSEI I
Pass that thing. I need that, (sucks deeply on the joint) I thought it was all over. I thought that was going to be it. I turned white. Now I know what it feels like to be white.
SANSEI III

RIA walks out. Raucous laughter. SOUND of James Brown: "Like a Sex Machine." Camera follows SOUND into living room, now darkened with red lamps and bouncing bodies. JAMES BABA has a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, feet twisting and torso pumping. RIA dances into the crowd of sweaty bodies and he moves toward her, smoking and gyrating. Get up. Get on up.

MINISTER OF DEFENSE
We're gonna take this step by step. Today, lesson number one, we're gonna get some basics covered. Identification. What we got here are your basic handguns. This one here is a Browning automatic with a three-shot magazine. Safety features: you need the magazine to fire it; see how that works? (clicks in the magazine) It weighs thirty-two ounces. Compare that to this one here, a Colt Commander that weighs twenty-six ounces. It uses a seven-shot magazine. Notice the difference with this heavy-duty Colt with a revolver, (spins the barrel) It packs six shots in the cylinder. It's an official police revolver. Here's another pistol they make for the pigs. It's a Llam model 8 automatic. Comes point-38 or pointy. Notice that we don't have any point-22S or point-25s. The difference is in the range. Not to be chauvinist or nothing, but the 22's a lady's gun, the kind she pulls out of her little purse. Not that it won't put you away, but you gotta get close, see.
WOMAN MEMBER
Yeah, I see. (her hand forms a gun and punches the speaker in his stomach)
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
Ow! Shit. O.K. I'm joking, (laughter) All right. So let's take a look at the slugs, what you call bullets. Depending on the caliber, you got different types for each weapon. Here you have the round nose (passes each one around), a flat point, spire point, and a soft point. And you load your magazine like this, (demonstrates) Or you load the revolver like this. O.K., everyone try this. Load and unload.
Guns are passed around the table and hands can be seen turning the guns, holding them for heft, loading and unloading, spinning the barrels, snapping in the magazines, etc.

KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
So now, everyone get yourself one of these pieces, and we're gonna take them apart, learn how they're put together, and clean 'em. (puts some screwdrivers and rags on the table) Take this Browning. Comes apart easy, see. (pulls the pieces apart and spreads them on the table) You take the pieces and clean them like this. Little oil helps. Now, what you got to learn (mixes the pieces up) is how to put it all back together. Next, lesson number two. I time you doing this, O.K.?
MEMBER I
(to MEMBER II) Hey, don't get your parts mixed up with mine, (something pops up) What's that?
MEMBER II
It's the spring. Don't lose it. Hey, where'd it go? (camera watches spring roll off the table)
Camera observes the different guns coming apart and then the fingers trying to remount them. Some MEMBERS work quickly while others struggle with one thing or another.
MEMBER I
How's it coming?
MEMBER II
Shit. Where's the trigger?
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
You put it together without the trigger?
MEMBER II
I think I lost it. (gesturing to MEMBER I) Maybe you put my trigger on your gun.

SOMEWHERE IN SONOMA COUNTY
Camera follows a gray Oldsmobile down a country road, farmland passing on either side. Oldsmobile pulls onto a gravel road and parks in front of a barn. SIX FIGURES climb out of the car. They are variously dressed in T-shirts and jeans, denim or camouflage military-surplus jackets. The DRIVER opens the trunk and distributes a rifle to each passenger. Boxes of ammunition are passed around. The FIGURES lean against the car or the barn and work at loading the rifles. Meanwhile, one FIGURE walks into the distance and hammers a target onto the trunk of a tree. He counts out paces from the tree and rubs a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
So your mark is there. Who's up first?
MEMBER I
O.K.
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
(noticing MEMBER I's stance) That's good. Cup your left hand here. The heel goes here against your shoulder. Get comfortable. You're sighting through with your right eye. Watch it line up. Take your time.

MEMBERS
Hey, someone made a bull's-eye!
Lucky shot.
Count how many hit the target, (counts)
All that shooting and this is all we did?
We couldn't hit a cow if we tried.

SOUND of automatic weapons blasting. At some moment the tree, which is not very large, begins to waver and creak and falls over. As the tree topples, SOUND of James Brown: "Super Bad."
10      1972: PINE METHODIST CHURCH——SAN FRANCISCO J-TOWN
Growing crowd of mostly JAPANESE AMERICAN people—a mixed group of nisei and sansei and a few issei—slowly filling the social hall of the Pine Methodist Church. Metal folding chairs are arranged on linoleum flooring in front of another projector screen on tripod feet at one end of the hall. In the middle of an aisle created by the arranged chairs is a large film projector on a table, wires running via

extension cords to the back of the hall. At the front there is a standing mike with a cord trailing back to a wall. A JTC REP, a young man, struts up to the mike.
JTC REP
Hi. I'm here to welcome you on behalf of the JTC. That stands for the J-Town Collective. We organized ourselves last year in August, coming together to defend the Japanese in our community. Our offices are on the corner of Post and Octavia, and we're open every day from seven a.m. to seven thirty p.m., so come check us out. We're working to build programs to serve the needs of our people: women's health, high school education, and legal services. If you want to know more about us, pick up a copy of our paper, New Dawn. Hey, JB! (motions to JAMES BABA, who is passing out a stack of issues) Our last issue here (holds up a copy) is dedicated to George Jackson and the Attica Brothers. You know, the JTC was founded on August 8 last year, and three days later George Jackson was gunned down at San Quentin, and three weeks later Attica prisoners took a stand and were slaughtered. Our dedication to these black brothers is to continue the struggle, to wage a war to defeat u.s. imperialism and to unite oppressed people. Part of our effort is to bring the truth to the people, and this film tonight documents the struggle going on now by Japanese farmers to keep the government from taking their ancestral land for an international airport.
Tonight is our first film show. Our next film will be ... what is it, JB?
JAMES BABA
Battle of Algiers. Here at Pine Church again next month, but we haven't set a date.
JTC REP
Battle of Algiers. Look for our posters for the date or pick up the next copy of New Dawn.
Now I wanna introduce Kaz Ono from the East Wind Collective, who's come up from L.A. with these brothers from Japan.
KAZ ONO
For those Japanese-speaking folks here tonight (speaks in Japanese) (SOUND of laughter and agreement from those who understand Japanese) (back to English) Tonight we have two guests from Japan, Tamura-san (gestures to TAMURA-SAN, who makes a slight bow), a member of the film crew from Ogawa Productions, who made this film, and Atari-san (also bows) of the Zengakuren student organization, who have been fighting with the Narita farmers against the government and corporate takeover of their land to build the New Tokyo International Airport.
TAMURA-SAN
(speaks in Japanese, which ONO translates) Our director, Ogawa Shinsuke, regrets he could not be here to speak about this film. Although Ogawa Productions is a communal project of fourteen people, we have a philosophy of being an invisible camera presence at the front lines. In 1966, the farmers of Sanrizuka in Narita City formed the Anti-Airport League to fight the construction of the airport. Our film, Sanrizuka: The Peasants of the Second Fortress, was filmed last year when the farmers had already been fighting for five years. We have been screening everywhere in Japan and now the world. We are also working with the Newsreel cooperative here in San Francisco.
KAZ ONO
We will be passing a basket around for your contributions. This is the only way that Ogawa Productions can continue their work. (JAMES BABA can be seen holding up and starting the basket around from the front row) Now, Atari-san from the Zengakuren.

ATARI-SAN
(speaks in Japanese, followed by ONO'S translation) After I saw Ogawa Production's first films, I had a complete change of mind. Not only I, but many students who joined the movement, were influenced by Ogawa's films. Thousands have joined the fight against the airport. Twelve hundred people were arrested and five thousand injured. The farmers built a lookout tower, trenches, and barricades. We in the Zengakuren came from different universities to support the farmers' struggle. We have been living with the farmers, helping to dig pits and carve spears, for example. We have been on the front line of defense against the police, and so many of us have been beat up and arrested. You will see how bravely the farmers have been fighting. We ask for your support in our struggle. You must protest the Japanese militarism that your u.s. government is promoting.
JTC REP
Just to let you know, we'll have a question-and-answer period after the film. So JB, can you get the lights?
Hall darkens as black-and-white film flickers on projection screen. Titles in Japanese with subtitles in English: Sanrizuka: The Peasants of the Second Fortress.
SCENES
Shot of wooden lookout tower and emanating SOUND of voice announcing the arrival of the police.
FARMING WOMEN in padded peasant garb and headscarves wind chains around their necks and torsos and then around a barricade of trees. They use large combination locks to secure their bodies.
As the POLICE approach, gasoline fires flare up in the trenches surrounding the barricades.
MOTHERS block POLICE in the first line of defense. One woman is yelling: "How can you do this? Aren't you ashamed? You don't have
148	KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
to do this kind of work. You could leave. Who is your mother? Does she know you are here?"
Camera sweeps over an immense field, presumably the airport runway under construction. As the camera pans lines of STUDENTS and troops of POLICE, the runway looks like an enormous battlefield. CADRES OF YOUTHS with helmets and towels covering their faces move with bamboo spears and flags across a muddy field. SOUND of whistles blowing at intervals to create the cadence of marching, much like pushing an omikoshi in a festival parade. Other CADRES move with their arms locked. It's raining, very muddy, and very cold. Everyone, although in layers of clothing and jackets, looks wet and miserable.
Scene of POLICE and AIRPORT EMPLOYEES roping trees, using bulldozers to pull them down, cutting chains, and dragging yelling women away.
Bloodied STUDENTS and FARMERS sitting in group, smoking and discussing strategy. Someone complains: "Nonviolent resistance doesn't work." A WOMAN says: "We should gouge out their eyes!" ANOTHER WOMAN: "Molotov cocktails and stones are called criminal weapons, but how else can we defend ourselves?"
Camera follows a FARMER into an underground tunnel. FARMER describes the work done to carve out the tunnel. Shows the room that has been created, where he has been living. "This," he says, "will be the last line of defense."
The camera on the meeting room slowly pulls away from the film on the screen, revealing the dark heads of the audience and the light from the projector flickering across JAMES BABA'S horn-rimmed glasses as he operates the machine. SOUND of Sanrizuka fades into SOUND of James Brown: "Hot Pants."

Weldon's Grocery, Kintoki Restaurant. Camera moves along both sides of the streets of Japantown: Laguna, Post, Webster, Sutter, Octavia, Bush, Pine, Buchanan. Camera scans the Miyako Hotel and Japan Trade Center, follows the Peace Pagoda up to its spire, captures various old business establishments: Uoki Fish Market, Benkyo-do Sweet Shop, Soko Hardware, and passes along institutions such as the Nichibei Times, Hokubei Mainichi, the YWCA, the Pine Methodist Church, and the Buddhist Temple.
Enter CANE offices on Sutter. Close-up of CANE sign: CITIZENS AGAINST NIHONMACHI EVICTION. Camera follows TWO PEOPLE, one of them SEN HAMA, who are carrying SEN'S disabled brother, HARRY HAMA, up the stairs, leaving his wheelchair at the bottom. Entering the upstairs offices, a GROUP of perhaps a dozen have already gathered. They are scrutinizing a series of photos and graphics arranged on poster boards.
SEN HAMA
(walks forward and holds up posters) So this is a map of Nihonmachi as it exists today. We've drawn it to scale to show each business and residence. You folks have been canvassing every street, so if you see something that's not accurate, let us know.
CANE MEMBER I
Well, since you asked, I'm on the residents' committee for Laguna, and you switched the tackle shop with the barbershop.
SEN HAMA
Oh, right. Remind me after the meeting. Now this (points to second poster) is a pre-1951, pre-Western addition demolition map, and you can see all the businesses and houses that used to be and are no more. And here are aerial photographs of the demolition to widen Geary. A twenty-six-block area of housing and business was razed for a thoroughfare. The folks living here were mostly black, Japanese, and poor. All were bought and moved out by the RDA.
JAMES BABA
Buchanan used to run into Geary right here (points), and both sides of the street were Japanese businesses. And all along Post were black and Japanese businesses. Promises were made that these businesses would move into the Trade Center, but mostly these folks sold their businesses and left. They couldn't afford the higher leases.
SEN HAMA
We're thirteen years too late. They started talks to build the Trade Center back in 1960. By '68 and five million dollars later, you got your Trade Center.
AIKO MASAOKA
O.K., we know we're thirteen years too late for those folks who got bought out cheap, but we're not too late for the rest of Nihonmachi.
SEN HAMA
Exactly.
HARRY HAMA
So what about the Nihonmachi Terrace? That's housing for issei, right?
JAMES BABA
We also put together a timeline so we can all be conversant in the history, (points to another poster) So here you can see the Terrace is projected to be a thirteen-story highrise. They broke ground but haven't started construction. They say they'll start next year.
SEN HAMA
Our position is to support their project to relocate residents. There's projected to be 255 apartments in the Terrace. What we can do is canvas the issei and make sure they fill out the paperwork to get a place.
CANE MEMBER I
What about the NCDC? What's our position on them?

JAMES BABA
The Nihonmachi Community Development Corporation is a group of eighty shareholders, sixty percent residential or business owners. They got together and purchased four blocks, this area here (points) that includes Buchanan. Sam Tezawa is the president.
CANE MEMBER II
Someone suggested that those guys on the NCDC got together and made a separate deal with the city.
CANE MEMBER III
We went to their meeting, and they don't want to listen to us. They're like the Chinatown Six Companies. They control everything.
SEN HAMA
It's not productive to make that comparison. It's better to go after the city Redevelopment Agency. Look, they razed the Western Addition block by block, then left it like a bombed-out area for how many years? Eight years. Then what do they do? They get these corporations with no vested interest in the old neighborhoods to rebuild for them. It's just an investment. The poor who are struggling to survive get kicked out first.
JAMES BABA
Really, we should go after Gintetsu. It's the real enemy. It's the corporation that now controls twenty-five percent of Nihonmachi, that being half of the Japan Trade Center plus the Miyako Hotel. Gintetsu is an extension of the Gintetsu Nippon Railway Company that has a monopoly on the Japan Railroad. It also owns Japan's bus services and taxi cabs, eleven department stores, fifty supermarkets, land and housing developments, nine hotels, travel agencies, recreation centers like baseball parks and bowling alleys. Manages all the Ford dealerships in Japan, plus Ford's air cargo.
CANE MEMBER I
Shit. What s Nihonmachi to them?
SEN HAMA
Precisely.
JAMES BABA
Gintetsu actually posted a loss on the Trade Center in 1968. Can you imagine? Said they lost two million, but I looked up their records last year. They made three million in the first quarter.
CANE MEMBER II
Where does all that money go?
JAMES BABA
Stockholders. New investments.
HARRY HAMA
We need to get a commitment from these guys to put these profits back into Nihonmachi. It should be part of the contract.
CANE MEMBER III
Gintetsu and the others, the NCDC, are already here. There's got to be a way to get them to share.
AIKO MASAOKA
That's so naive. Corporations don't get together to share, they get together to make money. It's capitalism. Liberals always want to make concessions that buy into a continuing system of oppression.
CANE MEMBER III
That's why I think we need a position on the NCDC. These guys are saying they are insiders protecting Nihonmachi interests, but all they want is a tourist town, to bring in business.

12      J-TOWN COLLECTIVE——SAME NIGHT
As the CANE crowd leaves, six JTC MEMBERS peel away to the J-Town Collective office in the next room, and sit around on its desks and chairs.
JTC MEMBER I
JB, that was great work on the timeline and the maps. You been doing that all week, keeping late hours here?
JAMES BAB A
I didn't do it all. It was Sen. He did the research and found the photos.
JTC MEMBER II
Can he be recruited?
JTC MEMBER III
We're working on him. He's coming to the Wednesday night study group.
AIKO MASAOKA
You know, we shouldn't just have that poster information in the CANE office; we should get it out to the public.
JTC MEMBER IV
Who's on the publicity committee? JB? You should be the one to make that suggestion. Also, write another article for the Hokubei.

KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
JTC MEMBER I
What was that all about in there, trying to bring up the NCDC?
AIKO MASAOKA
Isn't that what we agreed? We need to push to get folks to take on the NCDC. It's just another capitalist configuration.
JTC MEMBER II
No one seemed to go for it.
JTC MEMBER III
But they liked Sam Tezawa, Enemy of the People.
JTC MEMBER I
You're going to cause problems for at least one of the members. Bob's father is best friends with Sam. We need Bob's support. More importantly, we need his dad's support.
JAMES BABA
Moving on, guys—we were going to discuss the first anniversary of Okinawan reversion to Japan last year. Nixon and Sato want to renew the u.s.-Japan Security Treaty because of the strategic military necessity of u.s. bases on Okinawa. Did you know there are 117 military installations on Okinawa?
JTC MEMBER IV
O.K., just let's strategize. JB's on publicity as usual. He should write something for New Dawn. Aiko, dream up an action, like maybe we picket some Japanese dignitary coming through.
AIKO MASAOKA
We should also think about a tie-in to CANE. It's the same shit after all, imperialist military and corporate takeover of land that belongs to the people. Okinawans suffer from dual-repression: by the u.s. military and the so-called Japan Self-Defense Forces. It's an imperialist partnership. Same thing could be said for Gintetsu and the NCDC.

JTC MEMBER I
What time is it? Shit. It's two a.m.
Scuffle of chairs and coats as the MEMBERS clamber out of the office, down the stairs, and walk out together into the J-Town night. The fog shimmers against an occasionally neon light from a bar or CLOSED sign. JTC MEMBERS walk silently, following the red char of JAMES BABA's constant cigarette. Suddenly, he stops in the middle of the street and does a jig, twirls around, and whoops. Someone says: There he goes. Another: Shit, it's fuckin' two a.m. JAMES BABA'S steps pick up speed, dancing across wet streets and through fog. SOUND of James Brown: "Get On the Good Foot."
1974: HAVILAND HALL——SCHOOL OF CRIMINOLOGY——UC BERKELEY
Camera circles Haviland Hall. From one window on the second floor, TWO STUDENTS appear and a banner unfurls: Defend Criminology! In a second window, another banner: Hands Off Crim! As the banners appear, SOUND of cheers from CROWD below. TWENTY STUDENTS appear at various windows and wave at and show fists to the CROWD below. Among the students are RIA ISHII and WAYNE TAKABAYASHI, Professor Tom Takabayashi s son. A rope is thrown down, and the CROWD rushes forward with bundles in bags. These bundles are hoisted up through the windows.
VOICE
What's going on here?
REP FOR HAVILAND TWENTY
Twenty protestors have succeeded in occupying the second floor of Haviland Hall and the offices of the School of Criminology. They've done this to protest the order by the Regents to close the school.
VOICE What do you mean "occupied?"
REP FOR HAVILAND TWENTY
They've locked themselves in the offices on the second floor.
They won't leave until our demands to keep the school open
are met.
VOICE What are those bundles being pulled up on ropes?
REP FOR HAVILAND TWENTY
Those are blankets and food supplies. We in Ethnic Studies have organized a united front to support this effort. We've also sent up a bullhorn.
STUDENT appears at window on a bullhorn.
STUDENT ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
CROWD ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
STUDENT
Haviland Hall is now under occupation by the students of the School of Criminology! (CROWD cheers) We have not taken this action lightly. All of us have put our lives on the line to make a statement to the Regents and the chancellor. Traditionally, this school has been a technical school to train police in things like police science forensics, but times have changed, and to meet these changes, we need to study the true nature of crime, punishment, and justice, and of rehabilitation in our society.
Camera fixes on speeches and events at Haviland into the night. A small crowd of vigilant PROTESTORS remains at the base of the building, wrapped in blankets. At around three in the morning, a contingent of POLICE run into the building. The camera follows them as they bust through doors, throwing off the barricades of chairs and tables. They grab the STUDENTS, cuff and arrest them, and haul them out into the dark in a line. PROTESTORS jeer the POLICE and cheer THE HAVILAND TWENTY as they are pushed into paddy wagons and driven away. Meanwhile, POLICE push PROTESTORS away from the building and set up barricades with sawhorses and tape.

As light rises on the campus, the camera follows a second group of PROTESTORS jumping the barricades and rushing toward the building. These STUDENTS chain themselves together and to the doors. The POLICE beat the STUDENTS with their clubs, saw off the chains, and drag them off. By late day, there are thousands of PROTESTORS surrounding Haviland Hall, marching and chanting: FREE THE HAV-ILAND TWENTY!
SOUND of James Brown: Tapa Don't Take No Mess"
14      1975: WESTERN ADDITION REDEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION OFFICE——SAN FRANCISCO
Camera marches behind a delegation of TEN MEMBERS OF CANE, or Citizens Against Nihonmachi Evictions, following them into the office of the DIRECTOR of the Western Addition Redevelopment Administration. One of the members, HARRY HAMA, is pushed in a wheelchair. All are in their twenties except for one man who could be their father. One young man is black. JAMES BABA pulls a statement from his pocket and reads it.
JAMES BABA
We are CANE, representing the residents of Japantown at 1772 Sutter and other locations. We demand, one, that the RDA stop the demolition of 1772 Sutter; two, that the RDA repair 1772 Sutter for low-rent housing; and three, that the RDA repair other affected buildings, such as 1622 Laguna. We will not leave until our demands are met.
DIRECTOR
Your community has been aware of the plans for Sutter Street for many months now. These plans were agreed upon by the Nihonmachi Community Development Corporation, which legally represents the Japantown business community.
JAMES BABA
The NCDC does not represent the people of our community. It is a conglomerate of well-to-do property owners and busi-
ness interests in collaboration with the Gintetsu Corporation. Their aims are selfish and do not account for the lives of longtime renters who have lived and operated their businesses in Nihonmachi for generations.
DIRECTOR
Well, perhaps what we should do is schedule a meeting with all of the parties concerned to resolve this question.
AIKO MASAOKA
A meeting can be agreed on, but first we have to be assured that 1772 Sutter will not be demolished. Your people have been harassing the residents with evictions. They have nowhere to go or live.
DIRECTOR
They've been informed properly for a long time. Your group has been tearing down our notices and disrupting the process.
AIKO MASAOKA
Your process, as you call it, is causing the breakup of our community. The people you are evicting have already suffered evacuation and internment in concentration camps.
DIRECTOR
My understanding from canvassing the Japantown businesses is that the majority supports the current redevelopment project. Your group is creating unnecessary confusion and divisiveness. Let me make some calls—
The RDA DIRECTOR reaches for the phone. HARRY HAMA pulls out a chain hidden on his lap under his jacket, and NINE PROTESTORS quickly chain and lock their arms together. The TENTH PROTESTOR, another woman, rushes to the door, locks it from the inside, and runs out. The RDA DIRECTOR puts down the phone and nervously looks at the NINE PROTESTORS blocking his door.
JAMES BABA

Meanwhile, on the street outside the RDA offices, one hundred PROTESTORS picket with signs in Japanese and English: STOP EVICTION NOW! SAVE NIHONMACHI FROM THE RDA! J-TOWN FOR THE PEOPLE, NOT THE TOURISTS/
Two hours later, the chained protestors in the RDA DIRECTOR'S office are still chanting. They are also sweating under their heavy coats, worn in anticipation of holding forth through the night.
SOUND of POLICE banging at the door, forcing it open. Police rush in, apply gigantic cutters to the chain, and drag eight of the protestors away. The RDA DIRECTOR stands up and leaves, but the last protestor, HARRY HAMA, remains in his wheelchair, waiting to be arrested. SOUND of PROTESTORS chanting as they are dragged away: ALL
POWER TO THE PEOPLE! STOP EVICTION NOW! HARRY HAMA
Hey! Hey! (SOUND of commotion and chanting fading into quiet. No one answers. HARRY HAMA finally shrugs in frustration and wheels himself out.)
Camera follows HARRY HAMA to elevator and out of the building to the jeering and chanting of the picketing crowd outside. He gives the power sign to loud cheering. KEN, a young attorney, meets the PROTESTORS as they are taken away in a paddy wagon. HARRY rolls forward, wanting to get in too.
KEN
Harry, forget it. You've done enough. I'll take you home, O.K.?
HARRY HAMA Ken, it's discrimination, you know.
KEN
I know. Come on.

HARRY sighs. Rising SOUND of James Brown: "The Payback." PICK-ETERS continue their commotion as KEN and HARRY watch the paddy wagon doors close and the vehicle pull out into traffic. Everyone raises their fists in power signs.
15       1976: J-TOWN COLLECTIVE/CANE——OFFICES ON SUTTER STREET
Meeting is already in session in the CANE offices. Camera pans faces and captures a sense of rising tension.
MEMBERS (speaking variously)
So, we've called this meeting because we think there is a growing number of our members who are worried about the direction we've been taking. We're being seen by the community as a radical organization of outsider students.
This perception is definitely hindering our work. We need to grow our membership and support. People are afraid to join us even if they agree with our position.
For example, when certain members blocked the merchants' plan for a low-cost housing and retail space. Supporters were criticized for promoting capitalism. Has anybody considered that the merchants need their businesses to survive?
But we've been working to close this gap between CANE activists and the general membership.
Activists are fine, but provocateurs? What?
I think, and I don't want to point fingers, but I think some of our membership has double interests. I don't say they are manipulating things, but—
I disagree. I think some of our committees have been coerced into committing actions that we don't all agree on. For example, that campaign against the NCDC, calling their leadership Enemies of the People. Who decided we should plaster Nihonmachi with those flyers of their faces everywhere?
I HOTEL
161
That was really damaging. We lost a lot of support. It was
really poor judgment.
I think we all know who's been responsible for this trend all along, and we need to recognize that we've been too quiet. We know these people have done a lot of groundwork, but that doesn't mean we go along with everything they say.
One of our catchwords is unity. But what's happening is undermining the trust of our members.
Why don't you just say it? The JTC has been planning everything in those offices next door and then implementing their plans at CANE. CANE is not a Maoist-Marxist organization. It's a community organization fighting for the people.
I don't see how the JTC'S politics is involved in this. The hardest workers in CANE are also members of JTC.
But CANE is not an arm of the JTC.
Who do you think started CANE in the first place?
Oh no, we're not your fuckin' mass organization. It's not like that. Either you play by our rules or you leave.
Fuckin' shit! (jumps up) Hey, cool it.
You guys don't want community. You just want to bring it down. Fuckin' anarchists is what you are.
You don't know what you're talking about. We've been trying to raise a critical question: What is Nihonmachi? Is it a Japanese ghetto or an all-races, low-income neighborhood? We've got Clarence Spear's barbershop and Weldon's Grocery. Can we afford to be narrow nationalists? This has got to be struggled with.
What's "narrow nationalist"?
162
KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
It's just talk to confuse the issues. Fuck it. I got better things to do. JTC MEMBERS stand up and leave the meeting.
16      GENERAL MEETING——MORNING STAR SCHOOL, NIHONMACHI
General meeting of CANE held in the lunch hall of the Morning Star School. The CROWD of two hundred is very mixed: Japanese sansei and nisei, some issei, a sprinkling of African Americans and Chinese Americans. Children are running about and around the tables. They are all coming from a potluck line of food, their paper plates piled with chicken teriyaki, salads, musubis, cupcakes, Jell-O, etc. They sit along the low benches of the lunch tables and start in with plastic forks and wooden chopsticks. A woman comes around with a brass pot of hot tea and pours it into Styrofoam cups. A nisei man, CANE'S PRESIDENT, walks to a standing microphone at the front of the hall.
CANE PRESIDENT
Thank you for coming out tonight. This is CANE'S third anniversary dinner. I don't think any of us knew what was ahead when we started, that we'd even still be here after three years. I guess I'd have to say that, unfortunately, we've had to be here this long. It's been a lot of hard work and there's more work to come. We've had some successes, and the committees want to share this with you tonight. Then we want to open a forum to talk about what's ahead for CANE.
17      J-TOWN COLLECTIVE OFFICE ON SUTTER
Meanwhile, JTC MEMBERS are moving up and down the stairs with office furniture, desks, file cabinets, shelves, books, papers, lamps, chairs, mimeograph machines, telephones. Everything is hauled off into a waiting truck on the street. It's dark, no one else in sight on Sutter Street. The camera takes a last look into the old offices before the light is turned off. All the posters have been ripped off; nothing remains. JAMES BABA uses the claw of a hammer and yanks out the J-Town Collective plaque on the door. He runs down the stairs and
