on a potato farm in Idaho. He requests co draft status, self-identifying as a Quaker. 4F status is granted in lieu of co. Takabayashi's family relocates to Chicago, and he enters the University of Illinois in Chicago at war's end, in 1945.
2        UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS——CHICAGO
Taped interview with Professor Takabayashi with stills of the University of Illinois campus in Chicago.
TAKABAYASHI
At Tule Lake, I worked in the infirmary as an aid. I was just a kid. I had to stay awake all night and watch over this man who had been beaten up. They brought him over from the stockade where they took what they called "incorrigibles," the No-No guys who wanted to repatriate. To this day, I believe that he was beaten up by the guards, but they accused some other nisei. My job was to watch him through the night. He groaned all night, in and out of sleep or unconsciousness, the blood caked up under his head bandages. I thought they might come to finish him off.. It was cold, and I was really afraid.
I wrote about this for a rhetoric class at the u, and the paper came back with a C for writing and a D for content, with the comment: What about Bataan? I went to ask the professor what this meant, and he said, "Exactly what it says." I sat down on the steps of that building and looked out over the lawns and that sea of white students. My father had already died in Chicago; my mother died a few weeks later. I left, took the train for Berkeley.

Takabayashi enrolls at uc Berkeley in 1947. During these years at Berkeley, he supports himself by working for the Alameda County Probation Board, handling probation cases for petty crimes. He attains his BA in psychology in 1951. In 1952 he receives a Fulbright to study in Japan.

VOICE-OVER
Completing his Fulbright Fellowship, Takabayashi returns to the United States and takes a job in Los Angeles as a parole officer in Hollywood. His parole cases involve celebrities and
heroin or marijuana charges.
TAKABAYASHI
Occasionally I did investigative work for the parole board, traveled up and down the state. I began to have questions about the people paroled, about the judges who made these decisions. You might have a three-to-six or a four-to-five split, and what about this split? What made them decide on

the same factual evidence? If the facts were the same, then justice should be the same, but this wasn't the case. Why?

Footage of Stanford University in the early 1960s. Still photographs of house in San Francisco, wife and growing young son. Takabayashi interview continues.
TAKABAYASHI
I applied to Stanford and was accepted. I did my dissertation on that question of the justices. I took actual parole cases and crossed out the names and decisions, sent them to justices around the state, and had them retry the cases on paper. In all cases, the results were different. Some counties were more stringent, others less. The decisions were ultimately preferential, personal, and ideological.
VOICE-OVER
While Takabayashi does his doctoral research, his wife Jean works as a secretary for the attorney Wayne M. Collins, known for his defense of Iva Toguri, also known as "Tokyo Rose." During these years, renegade attorney Collins fights to reinstate Japanese Americans who renounced their citizenship during the war.

VOICE-OVER
The uc Berkeley School of Criminology was founded in 1950 to instruct policemen. In the fall of 1964, when Professor Takabayashi joined the school, there were one hundred and nineteen undergraduate and seventy-five graduate students. The teaching complement numbered approximately thirty. There were forty-five upper-division criminology courses ranging from general introduction to field studies and individual research. The twenty-five graduate courses covered crime and the political process, prediction methods in probation and parole, and seminars in psychologic theory of criminality and problems of criminal responsibility.

TAKABAYASHI
I was a grad student who asked me to be on a seminar panel. He was in the process of founding AAPA in those days. I think they billed it as the Yellow Identity Conference. Maybe nine hundred came from across the state. The Berkeley folks spoke first. I did a talk on international issues in Asia and how we're affected here. I could see the Berkeley people were upset when we let this contingent from SF State College speak. Two fiery speakers, •• • and • , spoke about their strike. There were maybe two hundred officially at the talk. Ten days later a core group of about a dozen or more formed, joined forces with the Blacks, Chicanos, and Indians, and called for the strike.
Still photographs of the front of Takabayashi home in Oakland with telescopic shots of individual students entering premises. SOUND of camera shutter in successive shots.

Of the few tenured Oriental faculty at Berkeley, only Takabayashi agreed to support student agitators, opening his own home for frequent meetings.
Return to footage of student strikers in Sproul Plaza.

The Asians had the eight a.m. picketing shift. Jean drove out in the mornings to Bancroft and Telegraph and brought them coffee and doughnuts. They'd say, Mrs. Takabayashi, what are you doing here? It isn't safe! (laughs)

Footage and stills of students, teaching assistants, lectures, and meetings. SOUND of camera shutter. Also stills of course syllabus, copies of articles, reading list, associated fliers and articles, and list of registered students.
TAKABAYASHI
The students pretty much took care of that class themselves. You could say they invented it and owned it. Heck, they invented a new political category: Asian American. Then they took on Third World politics. It was a first. They stood next to the podium, sat around on the platform. ••••
example, I invited this white anthropologist who did work on Japan to lecture. I thought his work might be interesting, but they called him a racist. They stood up and confronted him and finally removed him from the podium.

amateur historians, one playwright, one bookseller/collector, an occasional poet, a Japanese-vernacular newspaper editor, a known radical JACL member, a church pastor known for his militancy, and student radicals.
TAKABAYASHI
Suddenly the students got what they asked for: Asian American Studies, but we had to find out what that was. We had to find the books, hire the teachers, create a system of knowledge building. And I had to juggle two hats: the Crim curriculum and the Asian American.
Footage of civil rights protests, atomic bomb mushrooms, and Japanese Americans leaving by train for internment camps.
TAKABAYASHI
I didn't think they were necessarily at odds. I believed there were two issues that had to be addressed: civil rights and war. What if you practice civil disobedience and are arrested? Is this a crime, and how should it be prosecuted? What about crimes against humanity? Hiroshima and Nagasaki? War crimes? What about the internment of Japanese American citizens during the war?
PRISON DAY SEMINAR——NEWMAN HALL, BERKELEY
Footage and photographic stills of participating professors and students at the School of Criminology in 1971.

VOICE-OVER
Wendy Yoshimura, who emerged with Patricia Hearst, heiress of the Hearst fortune, was released on bail to be housed at Takabayashi's house in Oakland. Presumably this was because Takabayashi was a former probation officer. As a small child, Yoshimura was also interned with her family at the Tule Lake Internment Camp during World War n, and her parents were alleged renunciants of American citizenship.

VOICE-OVER
In June of 1974, Chancellor Albert Bowker announces his decision to close down the Berkeley School of Criminology. The conservative faculty of the school blames Takabayashi and his cohorts. They also criticize his association with Ethnic Studies. One colleague characterized it as an invented racial science. Prior to this announcement, two assistant
radical Crim contingent, are fired; another, • ••••, a proclaimed Marxist and member of the Union of Radical Criminologists, acronym URC, is denied tenure; and the subversive lawyers in the group are sent back to Boalt Hall.

Stripped of his association with any school, Takabayashi is banned to an office in an empty campus building slated for demolition, where he meets remaining students who are allowed to finish their degrees.
SOUND of wiretapped phone voice: "Who is this? Who is this?"
VOICE-OVER
After a series of anonymous phone calls and a letter signed by "a friend," Jean Takabayashi moves out of the house, leaving her husband.
TAKABAYASHI
I learned the hard way that whether it's the prison community or the Asian American community, the academy will close ranks to keep that experiment with reality out. In a short period of time, we saw the politicization of prisoners and the criminalization of students. And this scared folks. Students saw three choices: go to school, go to prison, go to war. We challenged the idea that society, and therefore education, should be controlled by the threat of punishment and the history of race.
