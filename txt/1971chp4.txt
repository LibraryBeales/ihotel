If it's II Piccolo by day, it's Jigoku by night and into the wee hours. Say you're in the mood to descend into a little hell. The J-Town version is underground, on the corner of Post and Buchanan. Imagine you got those cold stone demons leering at the gate as you make your way into the bowels. Every step down says you are bad, you are so so bad. You feel the heat of your descent, but the sound emanating at the bottom draws you down. It's the sinful sound of the double ax. The man under the dusty lights is blasting through both sides of his mouth â€” two saxophones in a one-man duet. You fall in love at once, but Gerald K. Li is Sandy Hu's new boyfriend, though soon to be her ex. But while he's hers, she loves him so. As I was saying, he's outlaw number twenty-one, just released on probation after doing four months at San Bruno County Jail. Even though they got him for assault and battery and resisting arrest, Sandy maintains that her honey did time as a political prisoner, protesting the fascist administration at San Francisco State College.

So, there's Gerald wailing on his instruments: an alto to one side, a tenor to the other. Oh, he could do soprano, baby soprano, or any number of wind instruments. He's got a whole collection back home, antique reed pieces that don't exist anymore, flutes of every ethnic persuasion, nose flutes from the Philippines and such. He could abandon his saxophones for a shakuhachi if you like. It's all part of his extensive repertoire, understand? But tonight it's the twin saxophones that are in command. They hang from his lips like golden dragons blowing fire. Now, one thing you need to know: nobody makes music like this without
