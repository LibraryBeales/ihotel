I         MIDNIGHT——SUTTER STREET——J-TOWN
Footsteps down the empty street. A FIGURE is moving quietly from parked car to parked car, trying the doors to find an open one. The cars are wet and frosted in the fog, their interiors a dark secret. The figure pulls on the handle of a Volkswagen Bug—to his delight it's unlocked, but to his dismay a HEAD of straight black hair leaning against the door falls out, followed by its attached body, as he opens it.
Goddamn it!
Oh, shit.
AIKO MASAOKA
NELSON LOPEZ
AIKO
(half asleep and waking) What time is it? Is it that time? You fuckin scared me. JB (she gets out of the car to confront a figure she thinks is JAMES BABA), don't do that again! (scrutinizing the figure in the dark and realizing her mistake) Who are you? Where s JB?
166
NELSON
I dunno. Can I have your car?
AIKO
What?
NELSON
Gimme the keys, (puts his hand in his coat pocket and points it like a gun at her)
AIKO
That's the oldest trick in the book, (pushes him away) Get out of here! (gets back in the car and tries to close the door)
NELSON
(shoves the door back open and grabs her, pulling her out of the car) I said, gimme the keys!
AIKO (pulls a gun around and points it) Can you say, "please"?
NELSON
(puts his hands up) O.K., please.
AIKO
Do I know you?
NELSON
Can I just go? Just forget it.
SOUND of footsteps walking up the street. JAMES BABA is sauntering over, puffing on a cigarette. When he sees AIKO pointing her gun, he flicks his cigarette away and starts to run.
JAMES BABA
Hey! What's going on?
AIKO

So—

JAMES
NELSON
So, whatchu guys doing out here this time of night?
JAMES
Surveillance, man. We got to keep a twenty-four-hour watch on that apartment there (points) or Redevelopment might come and evict those folks.
NELSON
Oh yeah, I heard about that, (points to AIKO, who is still pointing her gun) Could you tell her to put that thing down?
JAMES
(nods at AIKO) Nelson, this is Aiko. Don't mess with her. I'm serious. She's a crim student.
NELSON
Shit, she was sleeping on the job. I coulda gone in there and busted those poor folks myself.
AIKO JB! He was going to steal the car!
NELSON Keep your voice down, would you?
JAMES
(looks down the street) Wait. Aiko, shut up. Get in the car. Nelson, get in the car. In the back. Quick!
POLICE car patrols street and passes by. NELSON looks out the back window then scrunches back down in the seat.
JAMES (to NELSON in the back) They're looking for you.
NELSON
I ain't going back. That cop killed his own partner. I didn't kill him! Who's gonna believe that?
AIKO You're one of them from the Mission? Los Settay?
NELSON
Los Si-e-te. Please.
JAMES
(starts the car and pulls away from the curb) Aiko, we'll take Nelson to your place.
What? No way! Yeah, no way.
AIKO
NELSON
JAMES
Just for a few days. Until we figure it out.

NELSON and AIKO are sitting at the kitchen table staring at each other.
NELSON What did he mean, you're a "crim" student?
AIKO I study criminology at Berkeley.
NELSON
No shit. You study guys like me. Hey, you're studying to be a cop! (gets up to leave)
AIKO
Sit down. It's not like that. Anyway, my school is being phased out.
NELSON What you looking at me like that for?
AIKO Just thinking. You could pass.
NELSON
Pass?

KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
AIKO
Well yeah, for Asian. So which of those Los Siete guys are you? Uno? Dos? Tres? Cuatro—
NELSON Who the fuck knows? Maybe I'm cinco.
AIKO
O.K. That's go. You know, Japanese numbers: ichi, ni, san, shi, go. You can be Goro.
NELSON
Whaddya mean, Goro?
AIKO
(gets up to check a pot of rice on the stove) We got to get you a Japanese name.
NELSON
Do I look Japanese?
AIKO
(starts to fry a couple of eggs)
We just say you're hapa. Mixed. You can be Nelson Goro Tanaka. Your mom was Mexican. No, Filipino. Or maybe Hawaiian. That could work.
NELSON My mom is Salvadoran. I ain't no Mexican.
AIKO
(looks back from the stove) Details.
NELSON It's different, O.K. We're not MEchA. None of that Chicano
shit, see?
I HOTEL
171
AIKO
I get it, different like Chinese and Japanese, (dishes out the eggs on top of a pile of rice and serves them to NELSON) But now you gotta be Japanese. First off, you gotta keep your mouth shut. Japanese don't talk, especially the guys. You got to be low-key and shy and boring, (hands him a pair of chopsticks)
NELSON
(holds up the chopsticks) Shit. You're crazy!
AIKO
Hey, you want me to hide you or not? (walks over to reach for the phone)
NELSON
O.K., O.K.!
AIKO sits down with a chawan of rice, cracks a raw egg over the hot rice, pours shoyu over that, and whips it all up. NELSON looks on, picks at his fried eggs with the tips of his chopsticks.
AIKO
(slurping up some of the egg-rice, looks up and snaps the chopsticks at NELSON) This time you get off easy. Next time you do it raw.
NEW DAWN—J-TOWN COLLECTIVE BOOKSTORE——J-TOWN
JAY, a man in his later twenties, is shelving books. Bobby Seale's Seize the Time, Edgar Snow's Red Star over China, Frantz Fanon's Wretched of the Earth, and Roots: An Asian American Reader. There are stacks of newspapers: Gidra, New Dawn, Getting Together. Also stacks of Mao's Little Red Book. AIKO walks in with NELSON.
Hey Jay. Aiko.
AIKO
JAY
AIKO
This is Nelson. Nelson Tanaka.
JAY Brother. (guys do handshake)
AIKO His dad and mine go back. 442nd.
JAY Oh yeah? You from Hawaii?
AIKO He was just born there. Brought up down south, L.A.
JAY
Right on, Nelson.
NELSON You can call me Goro. Folks call me Goro.
AIKO
(flashes NELSON a look; he looks down pretending to be shy) Goro wants to help out here. You got some work for him?
NELSON moves away and peruses books along the shelves while AIKO takes JAY aside.

AIKO
Jay, he's, you know, hapa. His mom was Filipino or Hawaiian. But then they came here, and he got stuck with the Mexicans back in L.A. Anyway, he's like, in that stage, getting back into his roots. So I thought maybe if he hung out here, he could read and learn some stuff.
No problem.
JAY
AIKO
(walks over to NELSON) So can you help out here? I gotta go to work. My shift starts in an hour.
NELSON Hey, (speaking softly) what's 442nd? Your dad? My dad?
AIKO
(grabs a book from the shelf) Here, read this. Study up. I'll see you tonight.
4        AIKO'S KITCHEN
Couple weeks later, NELSON has grown a goatee and his hair. He is trying to eat noodles in a bowl of soup with chopsticks.
How's work?
NELSON
AIKO
I'm learning. We're thinking of organizing a co-op, open our own garment factory. That way the women will have control:
hours, piecework, work conditions, everything. We could include childcare. (watching NELSON eat) Just get down and slurp it up. (demonstrates noisily) You're a guy, after all. You can be sloppy.
NELSON My dad was a hero, you know.
Oh yeah?
AIKO
NELSON
The 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Saved a bunch of Texans. More of us died to save a few of them. He was lucky to get out alive. (pauses) Do you think he should've lost an arm or a leg or something?
AIKO Don't go around exaggerating.
NELSON Maybe he died in the war.
AIKO You have to be born, stupid.
NELSON
Oh, right. My grandparents were in camp, meanwhile. What camp?
AIKO
Tule Lake. Grandparents are issei. Your dad was nisei, and you're sansei. Ichi, ni, san. Get it?
NELSON
You folks always counting. Jay asked if I had other brothers. I told him I was named after my dad's buddy who died in Italy.
AIKO
Quick thinking.

NELSON
You know, there's this guy who comes in and asks questions.
What questions?
AIKO
NELSON
One time he bought a New Dawn and asked about meetings. When did the editorial staff meet? Today he asked if I knew JB, if I have a number for him. He has to get in touch with him, has some shit to tell him.
Hakujin?
Who?
White?
AIKO
NELSON
AIKO
NELSON
(shakes head) Uh-uh. A real Asian. He could still be an agent. Hispanics must get recruited all the time. Why else we're so fucked up?
AIKO
What did you say to him?
NELSON Said I was new. Talk to Jay.
AIKO
What did Jay say?
NELSON
He's never there when this dude comes in. It's a vibe, you know. Could be a setup. I'm screwed.
AIKO
Let me talk to JB.

PICTURE:
Follows an old lady holding a bag full of groceries in one hand and a small child in the other. Follows them moving slowly up a hill. The kid is eating something, maybe a manju. When he's finished, the kid stops to pick up something on the sidewalk. They argue a bit, then continue to walk on. Then the kid's hat falls off, and they have to stop again. The woman puts her bag down, adjusts the hat on the child's head, then gathers up everything and continues walking slowly up. The camera stays back and the figures move away, becoming smaller and smaller.
VOICE-OVER:
z: "So then you got what they call "psychological warfare." It's like this fake stuff. Flyers with the group's name printed with shit they never wrote plastered all over the place. They have to run around and do triage, tear the things down, and then ask who did it. Fingers get pointed. Fights break out.
SL: Or someone sets up some meeting that someone important's supposed to come to. Folks show up, but the VIP never shows so they look like flakes.
z: Anonymous letters. Send a letter to a funder, could be the nice corner church. Suddenly they stop giving money for the breakfast program.
SL: Anonymous phone calls. Someone calls with a tip. Same tip for another guy on the other guy. Could be regarding a woman or money. Either will do. Starts a fuckin' war.
BAACAW——BAY AREA ASIAN COALITION AGAINST THE WAR—— MEETING——PINE METHODIST CHURCH
The meeting is already convened, and people are sitting around on metal folding chairs listening to a speaker. AIKO is sitting in a row toward the back of the room. NELSON arrives to sit next to her.

NELSON
Gomen nasai. My Japanese class got out late. Sensei is strict. You can't just leave. Gotta be dismissed.
AIKO Aren't you taking this a bit too far?
NELSON
I'm digging it. Getting my identity, man. So now, I'm getting me a Japanese girlfriend, too. (snuggles up to AIKO)
AIKO
(growls softly) Get off of me. (changes subject) Did you change jobs again? Mama Kintoki was calling for you.
NELSON
No. I still bus tables for her at noon. JB got me a job at the Hokubei doing the paper run.
AIKO
Damn. You've become Mr. J-Town himself.
NELSON Nihonmachi-san, that's me. (looks around) Hey, that's him.
NELSON
See?
AIKO
Who?
NELSON
Guy who showed up at the bookstore. You know, the inu.
AIKO Inu?
NELSON
Do I have to spell it out? (whispers) Dog. Spy. It's what we called those traitors in camp.
AIKO
(rolls her eyes but stays serious about the stranger) Never seen him before.
AIKO gets up and quietly walks to the back to talk to JAMES BABA, who is doing security at the door. He nods. Meanwhile, the meeting breaks up and JAY can be seen walking across the room to greet NELSON.
JAY Hey, Goro. Where you been?
NELSON
Around. Working for Kintoki and taking Japanese lessons. So I can talk to the customers.
JAY Cool. So, what's your status, man?
NELSON
Number's up there, but they're not going to find me. No forwarding address. What about you?
JAY
I did my time. Went to DC and threw my medals away. Nam's a racist war.
NELSON'S GUY comes over and puts his hand out.
GUY Hey, man. How's it going?
NELSON (looks at JAY)
GUY
You're Goro, right? I met you at the bookstore. Remember?
NELSON Don't remember. Sorry, man.
GUY
Great bookstore you got going. Great stuff. Better than that one in the I-Hotel—what's it called? Everybody's Books? Hey,
178

better than China Books even. Don't tell anyone I said so, but those Wei Min folks need to get their shit together better.
JAY
(shrugs) Different stuff.
AIKO
(interrupts) You walking me home?   .
NELSON Yeah. (to JAY) Catch you later.
6        KIMOCHI——SAN FRANCISCO J-TOWN
Front of the Kimochi offices. Sign in front says: Kimochi means "caring for the elderly." NELSON is helping an ELDERLY ISSEI WOMAN up the steps.
NELSON
Obasan, iidesuka?
ISSEI WOMAN
Nihongo joozu desu ne. NELSON looks up and sees AIKO running toward him.
AIKO
Goro. Did you hear? Bookstore was broken into last night. Jay just called.
NEW DAWN
Windows are broken. Books and papers are strewn everywhere. Shelves have been pulled down. Posters torn off walls. Lighting smashed. JAY is picking through the debris.
AIKO Didn't anyone hear them do this?
JAY
Should have paid attention to those calls.
AIKO
Calls?
JAY
Yeah, some jerk was calling, threatening to close us down. Yelled stuff like, You yellow Commies go back to where you came from—
What'd they take?
NELSON
JAY
Week's receipts. Maybe two hundred dollars. I was going to go to the bank this morning. Maybe we can sell this damaged stuff for fifty percent off, get some money back. Good thing we don't pay any rent.

NIHONMACHI FAIR
Buchanan Street between Post and Sutter is closed to traffic. Booths and tables are set up along the street. NELSON is standing in one booth underneath a sign that says Kimochi. He's got on a happi coat and sports a hachimaki with a red sun around his forehead. In the middle of his booth is a low table filled with little goldfish bowls. He's handing out Ping-Pong balls to kids, three balls for a ticket.
NELSON
(little kid throws first Ping-Pong ball and gets lucky) Hey, we got a winner! (picks up the bowl and pours the goldfish into a plastic bag, hands it to the kid) O.K., there you go.
AIKO
(comes by with a snow cone) Poor fish. They'll all be dead in a week.
NELSON Hey, where's my snow cone?
You want this one?
It's rainbow. Yeah.

9        TULE LAKE PILGRIMAGE
Caravan of cars drive up a dirt road to what appears to be an abandoned building out in the middle of nowhere. Cars park along the road and people get out, stretch, and wander toward the building.
This is it?
NELSON
AIKO
Yeah, I guess so. JB said that's the stockade. It's all that's left. No barracks. No lake. No evidence.
NELSON
Tule Lake's a dry lake bed. Hey,'look at this: seashells. (picks up tiny shells from the dirt) See what I mean?
NISEI MAN (MIYAKI)
(notices the shells) Ladies used to gather those shells and make necklaces.
AIKO Mr. Miyaki, I heard you built that stockade.
184
KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
MIYAKI
I was on the construction crew. Goro, your folks were here?
NELSON
My dad's family.
MIYAKI
You know which block?
NELSON
No, I don't.
MIYAKI
Did you say your dad was 442nd?
Yeah—
NELSON
MIYAKI
Maybe he was here with his family when he was younger and left earlier. If he's 422nd, maybe he left for another camp.
AIKO
That's probably what happened.
MIYAKI
You know the history of Tule? This is where they sent the No-No folks, the ones who refused to fight. That's the reason for this stockade. Jailed the guys who got in fights over it. Some were what you call conscientious objectors. Others were pro-Japan. We had all kinds. Yes-No. No-Yes. Maybe No-Maybe Yes. No-No. What's your dad's name? You know the name of your grandfather?
NELSON
No, I guess he died before I was born, but my dad is Joe. Joe Tanaka.
I HOTEL
185
MIYAKI
The WRA has old lists. Let me look it up for you. Where were your folks from originally?
NELSON
L.A.?
MIYAKI
You sure? Those folks went to Manzanar. So after the war, he went to Hawaii?
NELSON
Right. He went to bring back his buddy's things, and then he married my mom.
AIKO It's a good story, isn't it, Mr. Miyaki?
MIYAKI
That's the thing. Lots of stories. We've been silent all these years. You kids are right to make us talk about this again. Shouldn't forget as if it never happened.
NELSON looks over, then nods to AIKO, who also notices a GUY hanging around near their conversation.
AIKO Goro, where's my camera? (she moves toward the road)
NELSON
I'll get it. Probably in the trunk of the car. (pulls out the keys and walks with AIKO; after a distance, to AIKO) Shit, there he is again.
AIKO
Bad vibes.
NELSON
So, where did my folks come from to Tule?
186
KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
AIKO
Let's research it. Maybe it's Washington, like Seattle or Tacoma or something.
NELSON I think my jig's up. I just have this feeling.
AIKO Ssshhh. (pecks him on the cheek)
10      KINTOKI RESTAURANT——NOON——SAN FRANCISCO J-TOWN
AIKO and JAMES BABA are having lunch at Kintoki's on Laguna Street.
MAMA KINTOKI
What happened to Goro? One day he's gone. He's a good boy, good worker. More dependable than you radicals. (chuckles)
JAMES What's that supposed to mean?
MAMA KINTOKI
You know, go off, get arrested, and don't come back several days.

JAMES
(teasing) That's the thanks we get?
MAMA KINTOKI
Just kidding. So far I still in business. I thanks to you. (pauses) How come Goro never tell me he's going to leave?
JAMES
His father has cancer. He had to go home. It was really sudden.
MAMA KINTOKI
Oh, that's terrible. You tell him I understand, but don't forget we're his friends. Aiko, you look so sad. Don't worry. He loves you. He'll be back.
AIKO
(hiding behind her tea, trying not to cry) Yeah, Mama.
Everyone looks up as JAY comes into the restaurant. He's got a stack of New Dawn papers. He joins JAMES BABA and AIKO at their table.
JAY
Hot off the press. (passes out copies) Take a look. We outed that agent. (he points to an article with a photograph)
