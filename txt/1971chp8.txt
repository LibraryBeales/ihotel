8: Dance
Time is the substance I am made of.
Time is a river that carries me away, but I am the river;
it is a tiger that mangles me, but I am the tiger;
it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire.
Jorge Luis Borges
Now honey, not to confuse you or anything, but some of us are reading Borges instead of Mao. As far as Sandy Hu can tell, that blind old Argentine has something to say about dance, her dance. Accordingly, she choreographs the following piece based on the story of the outlaw Li K'wei reuniting with his blind mother. Sandy has this idea to combine Peking Opera with what Gerald is calling avant-garde jazz, as long as he throws in a little tango, her nod to Borges, of course. It's the Chinese butterfly harp, lute, and cymbals, plus avant-garde jazz from Gerald's double saxes. She's got Gerald in leotards and trussed up in something that's her version of a Chinese minstrel, trudging along the periphery of the stage for the duration of the dance. Maybe it's love. Most likely masochism. But Gerald is insisting that it's all about Archie Shepp's rendition of Mama Rose. Li K'wei's blind mom is Gerald's mama Rose. Isn't that sweet?
The dance is performed beneath the I-Hotel in the site of the old Hungry i nightclub, abandoned now to a bunch of Asian American artists who call themselves the Kearny Street Workshop. They say architecture is frozen music, and as architecture goes, this hotel's been long frozen, along with all the songs and comedy routines that came and went out of the little i. You have to imagine the molecules of Hungry's music rocking around between the old bricks, sliding across the dance floor, slipping around the stage, and wafting in a smoky trail across the bar. Now the old molecules are being pushed around by this new music. And this new music is pushing Gerald down one side of the stage when Sandy's two dancers appear from the back wings. The frozen becomes fluid in the form of dance.

But what is Asian American dance? Sandy wants to know. Does the body have a memory? What's the memory of the Asian American body? She says she choreographs as if blind. Choreographs as if deaf. Choreographs in silence. Sandy says you got to feel the body's energy. Watch for texture and density and intensity. Fill the space like pictographs splashed across rice paper.

9: Yellow Peril
Testing. Testing? (Screech. Crackle. Crackle.) Testing. Testing. TESTING. Oh. Ouch. Honey, can you hear me? (We can hear you!) Brothers and Sisters, welcome to the second annual picnic for the Bay Area Asian American Coalition Against the War. (Right on!) How are you all doing? (Yeah!) It's marvelous to see this kind of turnout. Now those of you who are still arriving, James and Goro are setting up more tables for your potluck. And those of you who haven't already been chowing down, get over there before the chashu baos and musubis get gobbled up. Now if there aren't enough plates, just pile that food up on those Frisbees. And you know Mrs. Takabayashi made her famous teriyaki chicken again this year, and I already got my drumstick, (waves it around) so go on now and get yours.
Oh yeah, and we're passing around the bucket today. We're asking for your generous contributions for the I-Hotel, which is needing your assistance for repairs and to paint it with a big mural. Hey, Sen! Did I get that right? And you all know I live in that hotel, so you better make it pretty.
Now to open our program today, I'd like you to welcome, at your peril, Jack, Stony, and Aiko of the Yellow Pearl! (scattered applause, sound of clomping feet on the risers, adjustments to microphones as three performers step upâ-Jack Sung and Aiko Masaoka, with acoustic guitars, and Stony Ima with taiko and shakuhachi)
Someone yells: Hey Jack! You gonna sing us a folk song or what?
Jack: That's right. I'm gonna sing you a folk song! Aiko, Stony, you know that poem about two roads diverging in the woods?
Stony: And you took the one less traveled by?
Jack: Not me. I took the train!
Someone: Fuckin' chonk Chinaman!
Jack: Who said that?
Someone: I did!
Jack: Gerald? What are you doing here?
