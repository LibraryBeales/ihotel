9: Yellow Peril
Testing. Testing? (Screech. Crackle. Crackle.) Testing. Testing. TESTING. Oh. Ouch. Honey, can you hear me? (We can hear you!) Brothers and Sisters, welcome to the second annual picnic for the Bay Area Asian American Coalition Against the War. (Right on!) How are you all doing? (Yeah!) It's marvelous to see this kind of turnout. Now those of you who are still arriving, James and Goro are setting up more tables for your potluck. And those of you who haven't already been chowing down, get over there before the chashu baos and musubis get gobbled up. Now if there aren't enough plates, just pile that food up on those Frisbees. And you know Mrs. Takabayashi made her famous teriyaki chicken again this year, and I already got my drumstick, (waves it around) so go on now and get yours.
Oh yeah, and we're passing around the bucket today. We're asking for your generous contributions for the I-Hotel, which is needing your assistance for repairs and to paint it with a big mural. Hey, Sen! Did I get that right? And you all know I live in that hotel, so you better make it pretty.
Now to open our program today, I'd like you to welcome, at your peril, Jack, Stony, and Aiko of the Yellow Pearl! (scattered applause, sound of clomping feet on the risers, adjustments to microphones as three performers step upâ€”-Jack Sung and Aiko Masaoka, with acoustic guitars, and Stony Ima with taiko and shakuhachi)
Someone yells: Hey Jack! You gonna sing us a folk song or what?
Jack: That's right. I'm gonna sing you a folk song! Aiko, Stony, you know that poem about two roads diverging in the woods?
Stony: And you took the one less traveled by?
Jack: Not me. I took the train!
Someone: Fuckin' chonk Chinaman!
Jack: Who said that?
Someone: I did!
Jack: Gerald? What are you doing here?

Gerald (the someone): What do you think? I'm eating!
Jack: Hey Pearls, that's him. He's the one who took the road less traveled.
Aiko: You mean Li K'wei, who took revenge for his mother's death by killing four tigers?
Jack: Yeah, that's him.
Stony: I don't believe it.
Gerald: You talking about me?
Jack: Gerald, shut up and get yourself another beer. We're going to serenade you with a folk song.
Aiko: Before we start, I want to dedicate our song in solidarity to the Vietnamese people and their struggle for liberation, (nods at Stony Ima> who starts up the song with a plaintive shakuhachi)
(guitar chords)
(slow to vigorous taiko)
(chorus)
Big bad Li K'wei
Bold and brutal
Iron-fisted
Godzilla of a man
Feed him fifty bowls of rice
(feed him fifty bowls of rice!)
Feed him fifty bowls of wine
(feed him fifty bowls of wine!)
Then turn him loose
A revolutionary wind
A revolutionary fire
Warrior bandit with your battleaxes
Spin your weapons into whirling wind (extended shakuhachi)
Avenge the slaughter of your motherland
Scatter mountains into sand
(chorus)
286
KAREN TEI YAMASHITA
(taiko interlude)
Warrior bandit with your battleaxes Maligned today and called a simple thief Struggle for the righteous and the quest Defeat the paper tigers of the west
A revolutionary wind (feed the hungry bandit Fifty bowls of rice!) (taiko)
A revolutionary fire (feed the hungry bandit fifty bowls of wine!) (taiko)
Warrior bandit with your battleaxes In the darkest forests of the night Search out the tiger's crudest bluest eye And split its fearful symmetry (shrill shakuhachi)
(chorus)
(wild taiko finish)
(applause)
Gerald: Who wrote that fuckin folk song? Shit.
